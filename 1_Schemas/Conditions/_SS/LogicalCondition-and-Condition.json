// Note:
// To validata a generic Condition against the "base" Condition schema (which only requires a Name property) and another specific Condition schema, e.g. the LogicalCondition,
// we could build a combined schema as follows, but this is complex as their relationship is Inheritance and not Composition, for which Json Schema does not allow any mechanism.
// If the "base" Condition were an interface instead, exposing all required properties of any implementing type, then Json Schema would enable the required validation.
// Refer to the single Condition schemas instead (e.g. LogicalCondition).
